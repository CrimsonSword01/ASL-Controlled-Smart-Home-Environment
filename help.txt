Explanation of Program:
SLISH is designed to act like a smart home by turning Smart Plugs On or Off. Instead of voice command however, our system turns plugs 
On or Off by using American Sign Language (ASL) letters and numbers.

The way you give a command to our system is by giving it a sequence of two gestures, it will be a letter and then a number. Our system
only has access to the letters A, B, and C and the numbers 1, 2, and 3.  
      - The letter is used to signify the simulated device that we have hard coded to each letter. A is Fan, B is music, and C is  
      Lights 
      - The numbers are used to turn the plugs On, Off, or state the device. The number 1 turns the plug On and the number 2 turns 
      the plug Off. The number 3 prints what device the letter controls. 

As stated before our system only executes sequences of gestures. A sequence is a letter and then number combination in that order. An
example of this would be giving the sequence 'A1'. This sequence will print out Fan turned on. 
When you give the first gesture in the sequence (a letter) the user will have 10 seconds to give a number gesture. If the system does 
not recognize a number gesture within this time you must restart the sequence over again.

GUI Explanation (for Acronyms and Buttons):
Display Camera Feed - Once clicked, a pop-up will appear displaying what is shown through either your USB Camera or Internal Camera
Display Classified Feed - Once clicked, a pop-up will appear displaying what is shown through the camera with the background remover
      functioning. The background remover deletes the background from the frame (it does this via motion detection)
FPS - Frames Per Second
Gesture - The most recent gesture (letter/number) it has recognized
Sequence of gestures - The letter and number comboniation you are trying to execute
Command - Whether you are turning the device On or Off or stating what device is attached to the letter you have given it
Save Log Button / Delete Log Button - Save Log button allows you to save the log / Delete Log button allows you to delete the log 
(for security reasons)
Update Log Button- Once pressed, the log within the GUI will show all the processes that have been executed while you were running it. We made this a button because updating in real time takes a lot of processing power from your computer.
