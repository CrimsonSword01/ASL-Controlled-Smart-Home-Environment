Explanation of Program:
SLISH is designed to act like a smart home by turning Smart Plugs On or Off. Instead of voice command however, our system turns plugs 
On or Off by using American Sign Language (ASL) letters and numbers.

The way you give a command to our system is by giving it a sequence of two gestures, it will be a letter and then a number. Our system
only has access to the letters A, B, and C and the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Because of this, the maximum plugs our system can handle is 
three. 
      - The letter is used to signify which plug is which. Once you give your first command our system will try to locate a plug within
      your household and connect to it. Whichever letter you chose is now which plug it is  (i.e. if you did the gesture A the plug it 
      connects to is now "Plug A"). If you have more than one plug you must do a different letter for it to try to find more plugs.
      - The numbers are used to turn the plugs On or Off. The number 1 turns the plug On and the number 2 turns the plug Off. The number
      three currently does not do anything at the moment. 

For the particulars of our project, we only had access to one plug so we will only be using two sequences (for On and Off of whichever
letter is chosen) for demonstration purposes. Our program, however; does have the ability to connect to two other plugs. Examples of ASL 
letters and numbers our system can recognize are provided below.

GUI Explanation (for Acronyms and Buttons):
Display Camera Feed - Once clicked, a pop-up will appear displaying what is shown through either your USB Camera or Internal Camera
Display Classified Feed - Once clicked, a pop-up will appear diapplaying what is shown through the camera with the background remover
      functioning. The background remover deletes the background from the frame (does this via motion detection)
FPS - Frames Per Second
Gesture - The most recent gesture (letter/number) it has recognized
Sequence of gestures - The letter and number comboniation you are trying to execute
Command - Whether you are turning the device On or Off
Save Log/ Delete Log - Save Log button allows you to save the log / Delete Log button allows you to delete the log (for security    
   reasons)
