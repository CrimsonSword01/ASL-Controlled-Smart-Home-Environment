If the smart device (or just regular device) attached to particular socket is turned On, then it will turn Off the device by giving 
the command for particular socket it is attached to (and vice versa).

For the particulars of our project, we only have access to one socket so we will only be using one sequence for demonstration purposes. 
Our program, however; does have access to 8 other sequences if the user has more than one plug.
